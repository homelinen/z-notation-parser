# TODO #

* Change types to an enum
* Make type creation easier
* Make a representation for the empty set
* Fix Pointer references to avoid weird memory leaks (Subtraction is one)

### Joe's Notes/Suggestions ###

* Reference counting
* union storing different types in different branches

**Watch out for garbage collection.**
