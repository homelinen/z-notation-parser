# TODO #

* Change types to an enum
* Make type creation easier
* Make a representation for the empty set
* Fix Pointer references to avoid weird memory leaks (Subtraction is one)
* Refactor subtraction and intersection as code is close to identical.
* Create a head for sets and a proper create\_set method. Using insert for
  creation is sloppy.
* Modify int head parameters to use the internal flag of Sets

### Joe's Notes/Suggestions ###

* Reference counting
* union storing different types in different branches

**Watch out for garbage collection.**
